        Alice is the curious, imaginative, and adventurous protagonist of the
        story. She is a young girl who stumbles into Wonderland after following
        a White Rabbit down a rabbit hole. Throughout her journey, Alice
        encounters strange characters and puzzling situations, testing her logic
        and sense of reality. Her curiosity and bravery drive her to explore
        Wonderland’s eccentricities, though she often finds herself frustrated
        by its nonsensical rules. By the end, she learns valuable lessons about
        identity, independence, and resilience.

      <div class="queentxt">
        The Queen of Hearts is Wonderland’s tyrannical ruler, known for her
        explosive temper and her constant demand of "Off with their heads!"
        Despite her threats, she is more bluster than actual danger. She rules
        with fear, but many of her subjects only pretend to obey her. The Queen
        represents the chaotic, arbitrary authority of Wonderland and serves as
        Alice's final antagonist, showing Alice the absurdity of authoritarian
        rule.
