      <div class="aboutinfo">
        To effectively carry-out our mission of helping the disadvantaged and
        underprivileged people of the world, those of us who are involved in
        this worthwhile effort must sincerely adhere to some basic values. At
        the organizational level, both management and line staff need to believe
        in the following <strong>FIVE</strong> ideals.

          The ISC is following a humanitarian policy aimed at fostering progress
          and general welfare for the disadvantaged people. As community
          servants, we are performing a vital service to advance and promote the
          quality of life for all needy people. We must never forget the true
          measure of performance in social service work: “Today, how much
          suffering have we helped to relieve?”

          Adaptation to the ISC’s standards, and striving for excellence are
          encouraged at all levels. We must do our best at tasks about which we
          are knowledgeable; to seek learning and training for professional
          improvement, to build character and to think through on ISC’s problems
          and issues. We must believe that the best way to fulfill our duties
          and responsibilities is through working “by the task and not by the
          clock”.

          Harmony, courtesy and cooperation are to be emphasized in daily social
          as well as professional relationships, to maintain and promote a
          gentler and kinder work environment. Conflicts and differences are to
          be constructively and effectively resolved by using
          culturally-sensitive problem-solving techniques, such as the
          “acceptance time” approach.

          We must be grateful to the ISC for giving us a cause to serve in
          addition to a career opportunity. Loyalty by deeds from the heart and
          the mind of the staff is to be matched by the gratitude and
          sensitivity on the part of the manager. Every employee is to be
          considered as a source of ideas, productivity and quality.

      <div class="valuetxt">
        <p>
          Fairness in judging and rewarding performance must be the primary goal
          of management. This ethical standard is to be applied in a just and
          equitable manner. It places a high premium on trust and honesty
          between all members. Management must consistently demonstrate its
          reliance on wisdom and sound judgement to carry out its mandate. The
          main way of controlling and guiding the work of the staff is to be
          through implicit control mechanisms, based on the respect and
          understanding of the core values of the ISC.
